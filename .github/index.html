    <h2>Web Security</h2>
    <p id="web-security-question">How would you advise a potential client to secure his/her website from web security attacks? Note: the word count for your answer should not be greater than 250 words</p>
    <p id="web-security-answer">[To secure a clients website from attacks I would advice him/her to be aware of the most common threats and stay updated n the most “popular” threats at the moment.
        Using two factor authentication for the website. Get a verifaction code via sms, email or using an identity and access manager such as one login. 
        Also having your server use HTTPS to encrypt data between client and server.
        Another point is to sanitize input data. By modifying user data and removing markup in an html file it will remove potential vulnerabilities, since it will not be able to run scripts.
        In addition to that, test the security of the website by performing tests or mock attacs to ensure the security and safety of the website and eliminate potential security risks.
